# Wandelbankje Admin
Wandelbankje Admin is the management-side of the wandelbankje-app.
It provides a dashboard for administrators to manage everything that is going on, and also provides a dashboard for users to manage account data, reviews and more.

## How does it get it's benches?
The 'benches' table gets seeded by a python script every 24 hours. Benches are fetched from OpenStreetMap.

The code for fetching benches and storing them is available in my [wandelbankje-server](https://github.com/siebsie23/wandelbankje-server) repository.


## API
Wandelbankje Admin also provides the API for the Wandelbankje-app. The API is publicly available but this may change in the future.
